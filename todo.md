# TODO

- Thread Safety: Add multi-threading support in the Heap class using `std::mutex` for list management and `std::atomic` for lock-free Id generation. [+]

- Operator Overloads: Override array allocation operators `new[]`, `delete[]`, `alignas()`. [+]

- Double-Free Detection: Implement robust detection and error reporting for double-free attempts. [+]

- Reporting Interface: Expose an interface with strategy pattern to support custom reporting for `heap->ReportMemory()`. [+]

- Zero-Byte Handling: Ensure handling of zero-byte allocation requests. [+]

- Hierarchical Heaps: Implement a hierarchical heap system using a graph-based representation. [+]

- add all needed overridden `new`, `delete` operators to make sure the user won't allocate something out of the heap, also update the ISentry. [+]

- add memory pools, Chained Buffer Design with atomic operations. []
