/**
 * @brief Lock-free single-producer / single-consumer ring of Buffer pointers
 * 
 * @note Implementation: Waste-One-Slot SPSC Ring Buffer.
 * To distinguish between FULL and EMPTY states without shared flags, one physical slot is always kept empty.
 * `Usable capacity = (Internal Queue Size - 1).`
 * 
 * `RingPool<T, alignment, isDynamic>` implements a simple fixed-capacity
 * circular queue of `Buffer<T, alignment, isDynamic>*` pointers intended
 * for real-time-safe handoff between one producer (writer) and one
 * consumer (reader) thread.
 *
 * Key characteristics:
 * - Capacity is `queue_size` rounded up to the next power-of-two and
 *   stored in `m_QueueSize`. Fast wrapping uses the mask `m_Mask`.
 * 
 * - The class supports two ownership modes:
 *   - "Full" mode (pool owns buffers): the constructor allocates the
 *     per-slot `Buffer` objects and the pool deletes them in the
 *     destructor.
 * 
 *   - "Empty" mode (caller owns buffers): the queue is initially
 *     empty and the caller pushes owned `Buffer*` pointers into the
 *     ring. The pool will not delete those pointers on destruction.
 * 
 * - Single-producer / single-consumer intended: `m_WriteIndex` is only
 *   modified by the producer, `m_ReadIndex` only by the consumer.
 * 
 * - The class stores raw pointers to `Buffer<T,...>`; ownership is
 *   determined by the mode described above.
 *
 * Template parameters:
 * - `T`: stored element type (must satisfy `NotRawArray`).
 * - `alignment`: alignment used for buffers.
 * - `isDynamic`: forwarded to `Buffer` template; when `true` the
 *   `Buffer` objects perform heap allocations for their `T`.
 *
 * Thread-safety and ordering notes:
 * - `push()` is intended to be called only by the producer thread.
 * - `pop()` is intended to be called only by the consumer thread.
 * 
 * - The implementation uses `std::memory_order_acquire`/`release`
 *   semantics for the hand-off points.
 *
 * Usage examples:
 * - Pool owns buffers (full):
 *   `RingPool<float, 32, true> pool(false, 8, constructor-args-for-Buffer);`
 * 
 * - Caller owns buffers (empty):
 *   `RingPool<MyType> pool(true, 8); // then push(Buffer* ownedByCaller)`
